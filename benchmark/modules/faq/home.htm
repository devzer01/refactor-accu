                          Branding program. Credit unions achieving excellent 
                          performance are given the Asian certification called 
                          ACCESS or A1 Competitive Choice for Excellence in 
                          Service and Soundness. Being top in the benchmarking 
                          service would not mean an automatic certification. 
                          There would be an immense possibility that the credit 
                          union may pass the branding criteria. Finance, being 
                          one of the major criteria, uses PEARLS as measurement. 
                          Based on our experience, the most difficult criteria 
                          to achieve are in the area of finance. It only shows 
                          that financial standards are the impact of having 
                          sufficient and appropriate policies, procedures,
